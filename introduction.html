        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This report provides a data-driven assessment of potential fraud risks in submitted health insurance claims. Using multiple machine learning techniques and risk indicators, the analysis identifies claims requiring further review to enhance fraud detection, financial control, and operational integrity.</p>
        <p>The analysis combines rule-based scoring with advanced anomaly detection methods including Isolation Forest, K-Means clustering, and deep learning autoencoders to provide comprehensive risk assessment. Claims are evaluated across multiple dimensions including treatment consistency, claim amount deviation, visit frequency, provider risk, and geographic patterns.</p>
        <p>This report is intended for internal use by fraud investigation teams to prioritize claim reviews and identify systemic patterns of potential fraud, waste, or abuse in the healthcare provider network.</p>
